# Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a course preâ€“takeoff assignment. The goal is to apply SOLID principles for writing clean, maintainable code and to explore system design fundamentals for building scalable applications. It serves as a practical learning exercise to strengthen software engineering best practices, from object-oriented design to high-level architectural thinking.

## Features

*   Applies SOLID principles for writing clean, maintainable code
*   Explores system design fundamentals for building scalable applications
*   Strengthens software engineering best practices, from object-oriented design to high-level architectural thinking
